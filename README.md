## Port Scanners (Active)
### AutoRecon
AutoRecon is a multi-threaded network reconnaissance tool which performs automated enumeration of services. It is intended as a time-saving tool for use in CTFs and other penetration testing environments (e.g. OSCP). It may also be useful in real-world engagements. The tool works by firstly performing port scans / service detection scans. From those initial results, the tool will launch further enumeration scans of those services using a number of different tools. For example, if HTTP is found, feroxbuster will be launched. Runs curl, dnsrecon, enum4linux, feroxbuster, gobuster, impacket-scripts, nbtscan, nikto, nmap, onesixtyone, oscanner, redis-tools, smbclient, smbmap, snmpwalk, sslscan, svwar, tnscmd10g, whatweb, wkhtmltopdf, etc automatically.

## Stealth
### FireProx
Being able to hide or continually rotate the source IP address when making web calls can be difficult or expensive. A number of tools have existed for some time but they were either limited with the number of IP addresses, were expensive, or required deployment of lots of VPS's. FireProx leverages the AWS API Gateway to create pass-through proxies that rotate the source IP address with every request! Use FireProx to create a proxy URL that points to a destination server and then make web requests to the proxy URL which returns the destination server response!

It is sufficient to give to the extension the cookies of a low privileged user and navigate the website with a high privileged user. The extension automatically repeats every request with the session of the low privileged user and detects authorization vulnerabilities. It is also possible to repeat every request without any cookies in order to detect authentication vulnerabilities in addition to authorization ones.

* https://github.com/d3mondev/burp-vps-proxy

### Collaborator Everywhere

* https://portswigger.net/bappstore/aaaa60ef945341e8a450217a54a11646

### IPRotate
This extension allows you to easily spin up API Gateways across multiple regions. All the Burp Suite traffic for the targeted host is then routed through the API Gateway endpoints which causes the IP to be different on each request. (There is a chance for recycling of IPs but this is pretty low and the more regions you use the less of a chance). This is useful to bypass different kinds of IP blocking like bruteforce protection that blocks based on IP, API rate limiting based on IP or WAF blocking based on IP etc.
